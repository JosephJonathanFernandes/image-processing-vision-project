A comprehensive **Image Processing and Vision** web application built with Python and Streamlit. This interactive tool demonstrates various computer vision algorithms, filters, and transformations for educational and practical purposes.

## 📌 Overview

This project provides an intuitive interface for applying advanced image processing techniques in real-time. Users can upload images and instantly see the effects of different algorithms, making it an excellent learning tool for computer vision concepts and a practical utility for image enhancement.

## ✨ Features

### Core Application Features
- **Sequential Multi-Effect Processing**: Build complex effects by chaining OpenCV algorithms. Each effect stacks seamlessly onto the last.
- **Robust Undo / Redo Tracking**: Cycle backwards and forwards through your detailed operation history, all the way back to your original unedited image.
- **Automated Magic Presets**: One-click professional filters (e.g., Portrait Enhancement, Vintage Film) dynamically execute chained algorithms on your image instantly.
- **Interactive Comparison Engine**: Select "Show Comparison View" to natively display your original and newly processed components running side-by-side.

### Image Enhancement
- Brightness and contrast adjustment
- Image sharpening
- Histogram equalization
- Various blur filters (Gaussian, Median, Bilateral)

### Image Transformation
- Rotation and flipping
- Resize with aspect ratio control
- Geometric transformations

### Advanced Filtering
- Gaussian blur
- Median filtering
- Bilateral filtering
- Custom kernel operations

### Edge Detection
- Sobel operator
- Canny edge detector
- Laplacian edge detection
- Other edge detection algorithms

### Morphological Operations
- Erosion and dilation
- Opening and closing
- Advanced morphological transformations

### Color Space Conversions
- RGB to Grayscale
- HSV color space
- LAB color space
- Multiple color space transformations

### Special Effects
- Image inversion
- Custom filters
- Advanced visual effects

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JosephJonathanFernandes/image-processing-vision-project.git
   cd image-processing-vision-project
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   
   The app will automatically open at `http://localhost:8501`

## 📦 Dependencies

Core dependencies include:
- **Streamlit** - Web application framework
- **OpenCV** - Computer vision library
- **NumPy** - Numerical computing
- **Pillow** - Image processing
- **scikit-image** - Advanced image algorithms

For a complete list, see [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)

## 🎯 Usage

1. **Upload an Image**: Use the sidebar to upload JPG, JPEG, or PNG files
2. **Apply Quick Presets (Optional)**: Automatically apply chained effects with a single click in the Quick Presets accordion
3. **Choose Operation**: Select from categorized tabs (Basic Operations, Color Transformations, Edge Detection, Morphological Operations, Special Effects)
4. **Adjust Parameters**: Fine-tune specific algorithm settings using interactive dials/sliders
5. **Stack your Effects**: Click "✅ Apply This Result" to lock in the effect and stack a new algorithm on top
6. **Compare**: View original and processed images side-by-side using the Comparison checkbox
