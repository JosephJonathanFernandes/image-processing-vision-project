# Image Processing and Vision (IPV) Web App

## 📌 Overview
This project is an **Image Processing and Vision** application implementing a variety of methods, algorithms, filters, and functions from the syllabus and beyond.  
It features an **interactive web app** built with **Python Streamlit**, enabling users to upload images, apply processing techniques, and view results instantly.  
The project serves as both a learning tool and a demonstration platform for image enhancement, transformation, and analysis.

## ✨ Features
- **Image Enhancement** – Apply filters, adjust brightness/contrast, sharpen, and more.
- **Image Transformation** – Rotate, resize, crop, and perform geometric transformations.
- **Filtering Techniques** – Gaussian, median, bilateral, and custom kernel filters.
- **Edge Detection** – Sobel, Canny, Laplacian, and other operators.
- **Morphological Operations** – Erosion, dilation, opening, and closing.
- **Color Space Conversions** – RGB ↔ Grayscale, HSV, LAB, etc.
- **Custom Algorithms** – Includes advanced techniques beyond the syllabus.
- **Interactive Interface** – Real-time preview with adjustable parameters.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** – Core programming language.
- **Streamlit** – For building the interactive web application.
- **OpenCV** – Image processing and computer vision operations.
- **NumPy** – Numerical computations and matrix manipulations.
- **Pillow** – Image manipulation and format handling.
